13.2.1 Exercises
1.Imagine you wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from its origin to its destination. What variables would you need? What tables would you need to combine?

We need the plane$tailnum to connect to flights$tailnum. Then we would need to use airports$faa to connect flights$flight and flights$tailnum with flights$origin and flights$destination.For each combination of the airports$lat & airports$lon would be used for each of flights$origin and flights$destination to determine distance.

2.I forgot to draw the relationship between weather and airports. What is the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram? 

airports$faa is related to weather$origin

3.weather only contains information for the origin (NYC) airports. If it contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional relation would it define with flights?

flight arrival time

1.Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:
airports %>%
  semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap()
    
(Don’t worry if you don’t understand what semi_join() does — you’ll learn about it next.)

You might want to use the size or colour of the points to display the average delay for each airport.

2.Add the location of the origin and destination (i.e. the lat and lon) to flights.

airport_locations <- airports %>%
  select(faa, lat, lon)

flights %>%
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest) %>%
  left_join(airport_locations, by = c("origin" = "faa")) %>%
  left_join(airport_locations,by = c("dest" = "faa"),suffix = c("_origin", "_dest"))

3.Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?
Older planes have longer delays.

2.Filter flights to only show flights with planes that have flown at least 100 flights.

planes_100F <- 
  filter(flights) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  add_count() %>%
  filter(n > 100)%>%
  unique(planes_100F[c("tailnum")])

5.What does anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) tell you? 

Returns a list of flights that went to an airport that is not in the FAA list of destinations i.e.) foreign flights.

What does anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest")) tell you?
There are airports that flights are arriving from but are not in the domestic airport list.
